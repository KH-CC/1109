three arms and joint angle

first arm : controlled by 1, 2 key (each left and right)

second arm : controlled by 3, 4 key  (each left and right)

third arm : controlled by 5, 6 key (each left and right)

gripper (long side) : controlled by 7,8 key  (each left and right)

two grips (short side) : controlled by up, down key ( up : two grips become farther , down : two grips become narrower)

since robot arms are machine, I implemented characteristic that they are still stiff.

even if user keep pressing the key, it does not rotate 360 degrees. it only moves in specific range.

also, when bottom arm moves, also upper arms slightly move.
